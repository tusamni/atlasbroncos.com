		bio: "<p>Roger Niles is a builder at heart—whether it's scaling a multimillion-dollar business or restoring a classic Ford Bronco. His journey is one of innovation, leadership, and craftsmanship, shaped by both a distinguished career in technology sales and a deep-rooted love for hands-on work.</p><p>Raised in rural Missouri, Roger learned early on the value of hard work, ingenuity, and problem-solving. This foundation led him to pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering at Missouri University of Science and Technology, where he gained a deep appreciation for precision, mechanics, and the beauty of well-engineered systems.</p><p>For over 24 years, Roger thrived in technology sales, building and leading high-performance teams. After a highly successful 10-year career at NetApp, where he consistently exceeded quotas and qualified for President's Club 6 years in a row, Roger joined ClearShark in 2010 to transform it from a services-based company into an IT sales powerhouse. As ClearShark's first Account Manager, he set the direction and the culture of the company and eventually took on the responsibility of Vice President of Sales. Over time, he built and led a sales team of 56 professionals, ultimately driving annual revenues to over $500 million. Later, as one of the Founders of ClearShark Services Inc., he expanded the company into cybersecurity services, growing it to $3 million in annual revenue before its acquisition in 2023. His expertise in strategy, leadership, and innovation made him a key player in the industry, helping companies like Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, and FireEye expand their reach.</p><p>Yet, for all his success in the tech world, Roger remained drawn to the art of building—something tangible, something with soul. His passion for the 1966-1977 Ford Bronco led him to create Atlas Broncos, where he merges his business acumen with his love of craftsmanship. With a deep respect for both progress and tradition, Roger brings a unique perspective to every build—merging precision engineering with classic design.</p><p>Roger lives in Austin, TX, with his wife of 20 years, their two teenage children, and three dogs. When he's not in the garage working on Broncos, he enjoys spending time with his family and exploring the great outdoors.</p>"
